        "category": "The research aims at exploring possible benefits of Unsupervised Deep Learning (DL) techniques to reduce the dependency on prior annotations in 3D Image Segmentation. The research tasks include comparison of quality of segmentations generated using UNet and WNet based architectures with and without limited/weak annota- tions. The study extends Attention WNet architecture with the similarity and consistency losses proposed in the Differentiable Feature Clustering (DFC). The approach is validated by performing Pathology Detection(Tumor Segmentation) using 3D MRI volumes obtained using 3Tesla and 7Tesla scanners. Also, the study compares the resulting segmentations obtained using the proposed approach against non-DL baselines to analyse the efficiency of Deep CNNs in the field of Computer Vision.",

The proposed Vessel Segmentation approach was validated using limited annotated samples of high resolution 7Tesla 3D-MRA volumes. The qualitative analysis of ROIs re- vealed clear improvement in the continuity of vessel structures per- ceived by the Deep Learning network after incorporating MIP comparisons as one of the loss terms during training. The study is accepted for presentation at the annual conference of International So- ciety for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine(ISMRM) to be held at Toronto from 03-08 June 2023.",

The feature selection is then performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator(LASSO) to obtain minimal set of important features (Friedman et al., 2009). The api caters to a visualization dashboard that explores the model results dynamically and interactively.",
